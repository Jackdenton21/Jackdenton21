I studied Computer Science at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca) and am currently working as a Software Engineer at [Walmart Global Tech](https://tech.walmart.com/content/walmart-global-tech/en_us.html). I’m passionate about building software that solves real-world problems, especially in scalable and high-impact systems.
